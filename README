NAME
    Catalyst::View::Component::SubInclude - Use subincludes in your Catalyst
    views

VERSION
    Version 0.04

DESCRIPTION
    "Catalyst::View::Component::SubInclude" allows you to include content in
    your templates (or, more generally, somewhere in your view's "render"
    processing) which comes from another action in your application. It's
    implemented as a Moose::Role, so using Moose in your view is required.

    Simply put, it's a way to include the output of a Catalyst sub-request
    somewhere in your page.

    It's built in an extensible way so that you're free to use sub-requests,
    Varnish ESI (<http://www.catalystframework.org/calendar/2008/17>) or any
    other sub-include plugin you might want to implement. An LWP plugin
    seems useful and might be developed in the future.
