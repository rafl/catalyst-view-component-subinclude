=head1 NAME

Catalyst::View::Component::SubInclude - Use subincludes in your Catalyst views

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.04

our $VERSION = '0.04';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package MyApp::View::TT;
  use Moose;

  extends 'Catalyst::View::TT';
  with 'Catalyst::View::Component::SubInclude';

  __PACKAGE__->config( subinclude_plugin => 'SubRequest' );

Then, somewhere in your templates:

  [% subinclude('/my/widget') %]
  [% subinclude_using('SubRequest', '/page/footer') %]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Catalyst::View::Component::SubInclude> allows you to include content in your
templates (or, more generally, somewhere in your view's C<render> processing)
which comes from another action in your application. It's implemented as a 
L<Moose::Role|Moose::Role>, so using L<Moose|Moose> in your view is required.

Simply put, it's a way to include the output of a Catalyst sub-request somewhere
in your page. 

It's built in an extensible way so that you're free to use sub-requests, Varnish 
ESI (L<http://www.catalystframework.org/calendar/2008/17>) or any other 
sub-include plugin you might want to implement. An LWP plugin seems useful and
might be developed in the future.

=head1 STASH FUNCTIONS

This component does its magic by exporting a C<subinclude> coderef entry to the
stash. This way, it's easily accessible by the templates (which is the most 
common use-case).

=head2 C<subinclude( $path, @args )>

This will render and return the body of the included resource (as specified by 
C<$path>) using the default subinclude plugin.

=head2 C<subinclude_using( $plugin, $path, @args )>

This will render and return the body of the included resource (as specified by 
C<$path>) using the specified subinclude plugin.

The C<subinclude> function above is implemented basically as a shortcut which 
calls this function using the default plugin as the first parameter.

=head1 SUBINCLUDE PLUGINS

The module comes with two subinclude plugins: 
L<SubRequest|Catalyst::Plugin::View::Component::SubRequest>,
L<Visit|Catalyst::Plugin::View::Component::Visit> and 
L<ESI|Catalyst::Plugin::View::Component::ESI>.

By default, the C<SubRequest> plugin will be used. This can be changed in the 
view's configuration options (either in the config file or in the view module
itself). 

Configuration file example:

  <View::TT>
      subinclude_plugin   ESI
  </View::TT>

=head2 C<set_subinclude_plugin( $plugin )>

This method changes the current active subinclude plugin in runtime. It expects
the plugin suffix (e.g. C<ESI> or C<SubRequest>) or a fully-qualified class 
name in the C<Catalyst::View::Component::SubInclude> namespace.

=head2 Writing plugins

If writing your own plugin, keep in kind plugins are required to implement a 
class method C<generate_subinclude> with the following signature:

  sub generate_subinclude {
      my ($class, $c, @args) = @_;
  }

The default plugin is stored in the C<subinclude_plugin> which can be changed
in runtime. It expects a fully qualified class name.
